# Heyflow Coding Challenge
___

This repository contains the response to 2 Heyflow coding challenges:
1. [Custom Checkbox](https://github.com/emotu/heyflow/checkbox)
2. [JSON Explorer](https://github.com/emotu/heyflow/explorer)

Both the code for challenges are implemented in this repository as a way to organize the results. 
As such, there is no relationship between both directories and they can be reviewed independently.
